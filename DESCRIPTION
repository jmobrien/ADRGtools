Description: This contains all the various functions I've written for managing data and various tasks within a psych laboratory.  Much of it serves for variable creation and data processing of various forms, but there are currently some larger toolkits as well, such as one that constructs, runs, and plots specification curves (which will likely eventually be spun off into its own package.), and some code to check for problematic reportages in open-ended text responses.
