# PsychMisc

## Summary
This is a package containing all the different functions that people have used/proposed.  
The idea of putting it here is that people can maintain current versions of it using the 
install_github() function, while also creating a version on your computer that you can put
new functions into that you can push to GitHub so we all get it.

## Using the package

1. install/load devtools: *if(!require(devtools, quietly = TRUE){install.packages("devtools") ; require(devtools)}*
2. install the package: *install_github("jmobrien/PsycMisc")*
3. Try it out: *require(PsychMisc)*
